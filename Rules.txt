As the Tests get more Specific, the Code get more Generic.

"Stair-Step Tests" - small temporary tests that help you step your way into the tests/code.

1) Write the test that forces you to write the code you already know you want to write.

2) Make it fail. Make it pass. Clean it up.

3) Don't go for the gold.

4) Write the simplest, most specific, most degenerate test that will fail.
	"Degenerate" the most absurdly simple starting point.

5) Generalise where possible.

6) When the code feels wrong, fix the design before proceeding.
